# Feature Engineering Operators
All the operators are under directory `alphaml/engine/components/pipeline`  
Each operator has a method *operate(dm_list:List,  phase:{'train','test'})*
1. Parameter *dm_list*: A list of inputs.  
For InputerOperator, it contains a single DataFrame.  
For Data Preprocessing Operators and Feature Generation Operators, it contains a single DataManager.  
For Feature Selection Operators, it contains at least one DataManager.
2. The parameter *phase*: A string from {'train','test'}.  
If set to 'train', the operator will fit the inner operator(or estimator) and transform the inputs.
If set to 'test', the operator will transfrom the inputs according to the fitted inner operator.
3. The method *operate* returns a DataManager

## Data Preprocessing Operators
- **InputerOperator**: *params* None, *label_col* int default -1
- **LabelEncoderOperator:** *params* None, *label_col* int default -1
- **FeatureEncoderOperator:** *params* {0,1}  
    - 0 for One-hot Encoder
    - 1 for Ordinal Encoder
- **ScalerOperator:** *params* {0,1,2}
    - 0 for Standard Scaler
    - 1 for Minmax Scaler
    - 2 for Maxabs Scaler
- **NormalizerOperator:** *params* {0,1}  
    - 0 for L2 norm
    - 1 for L1 norm
    
## Feature Generation Operators
- **PolynomialFeaturesOperator:** *params* int 
    - *params* stands for degrees
    - For numerical features

- **PCAOperator** *params* int
    - *params* stands for n_components (the number of features needed)
    - For numerical features
    
- **AutoCrossOperator:** *params* int, *metric* str or Callable, *stratify* bool
    - *params* stands for max_iteration (the number of features needed). 
    - *metric* stands for metric function used in AutoCross
    - *stratify* stands for whether to stratify (True for classification, False for regression)
    - For one-hot features generated by a one-hot encoder 
    - Warning: The number of new features may be less than *params* due to early stop



## Feature Selection Operators
- **NaiveSelectorOperator:** *params* list [int,  {0,1,2,3,4}]
    - The first element stands for k in k-best
    - The second element stands for metric
        - 0 for chi2 (cls/reg, non-negative features)
        - 1 for f_classif (cls)
        - 2 for mutual_info_classif (cls)
        - 3 for f_regression (rgs)
        - 4 for mutual_info_regression (rgs)
- **MLSelectorOperator:** *params* list [int,  {0,1}, {0,1}]
    - The first element stands for k in k-best
    - The second element stands for task type
        - 0 for classification
        - 1 for regression
    - The third element stands for ML model
        - 0 for RandomForest
        - 1 for Lasso (or LogisticRegression with L1 penalty)
